# Epic 9: System Administration & Governance (Internal)

## Overview
Internal tooling for event health, aggregation monitoring, abuse handling, and system integrity.

## Scope
This epic covers internal tools and processes for system management:
- Admin dashboard and tools
- Event health monitoring
- Aggregation pipeline monitoring
- Abuse pattern detection
- System integrity checks
- Analytics and reporting
- Configuration management
- Emergency response tools

## Key User Flows
1. **Health Monitoring**: Admin views dashboard → monitors event quality metrics
2. **Aggregation Review**: Admin checks pipeline → troubleshoots failures
3. **Abuse Response**: Admin detects abuse pattern → takes corrective action
4. **System Config**: Admin updates configuration → changes propagate
5. **Incident Response**: Critical issue → admin tools for quick resolution

## Technical Considerations
- Admin authentication and authorization
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Alert systems for critical issues
- Audit trails for admin actions
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Backup and recovery tools

## MVP Priority
🟢 Medium - Important but can build incrementally

## Story Naming Convention
